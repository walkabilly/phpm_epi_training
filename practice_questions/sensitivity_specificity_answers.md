# Sensitivity and Specificity Answers

### 1. Answer:
  * a. Sensitivity (Sen): 8/21 = 38.1%   -   Specificity (Sp): 275/298 = 92.2%
  * b. The odds of DVT are 21/298 or 0.07. These are the pretest odds: they represent the odds in the absence of any information about the test results. The pretest probability or prevalence of DVT can be calculated from these odds using the formula: Proportion = odds / (1 + odds). For this study, the result is 0.07/1.07 = 0.066. Because the outcome is uncommon, the prevalence proportion is quite similar to prevalence odds.

### 2. Answer: To minimize the false positive rate, it is essential that this diagnostic test be highly specific. For some screening tests where the goal is not to miss a case (a false-negative result) the most important requirement is high sensitivity. The best tests have both high sensitivity and specificity.
