## Prevalence and Incidence Answers

### 1. The prevalence is 2,273,800/30,378,269 or 0.075, or 7.5%.

### 2. The prevalence is 9/401, or 0.022, or 2.2%.

### 3. Reporting prevalence as a count links directly to the number of people needing healthcare for that condition which is an advantage for planning and administration. However, since populations are usually of different sizes, a mere count is not helpful for comparing two estimates.

### 4. Prevalence (which quantifies how common a disease is) is approximately equal to incidence (expressed as a rate per time units) multiplied by the duration of illness (in time units). Since insulin is a life-saving treatment for people with insulin-dependent diabetes, its discovery lengthened the duration of illness and has increased its prevalence.

### 5. The calculation is correct. Because the time units in an incident-rate calculation are arbitrary, the value of the parameter can assume any value. Unlike an incidence proportion, there is no reason an incidence rate must have a value of less than 1.
