# Stratified Analysis and Regression Modelling Answers

### 1.1. Answer: 
* Scenario a is a situation in which there is no effect modification or confounding. 
* Scenario b represents effect modification. 
* Scenario c represents confounding.

### 1.2. Answer:
* Scenario d is a situation in which the crude measure of effect may be reported. As there is no effect modification, stratified estimates do not need to be reported and, because there is no confounding, adjustment for confounding is not necessary.
* Scenario e requires that the stratum-specific effects be reported. Both the crude and adjusted estimates obscure the heterogeneity, thereby misrepresenting the findings.
* Scenario f represents the occurrence of confounding. An adjusted estimate must be reported. The stratified estimates are adjusted, but are likely to suffer from imprecision. Therefore, an estimate with a model-based adjustment or a Mantel-Haenszel pooled estimate is preferable.

### 2. Answer: The odds ratio has the same interpretation as always: it is the ratio of odds of disease at a particular level of exposure to that of another level of exposure. In this case, it represents the change over 1 unit of age (in this case years). Often, the size of the estimate is tiny (e.g., an odds ratio of 1.01). In the case of age measured in years, this would suggest a 1% increase in the odds of disease per year - a sizable effect.

### 3. Answer: This way of thinking does not fit with the approach taken in epidemiological analysis. In epidemiology, the goal is usually to characterize an exposure-disease relationship, so modelling is primarily used as a tool to address the dual issues of confounding and effect modification. A decision to keep or remove a variable from a model therefore should not be based on its statistical significance, but rather on its effects (either in terms of effect modification or confounding) on an exposure-disease association. Nevertheless, you will encounter studies in which investigators have removed variables from a model because of a lack of statistical significance. This approach is not necessarily problematic, since the lack of significance may often indicate lack of association between the potential confounder and disease, in which case confounding would not occur.
